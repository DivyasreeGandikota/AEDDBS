Introduction:
Given the rising number of food-related fatalities each year, it is essential for those in a food crisis to properly request food from distributors and suppliers. This will enable them to distribute any surplus food to the appropriate group of people while also ensuring that the food is of a high enough calibre. They must establish a set of criteria for determining what constitutes an adequate food request in order to distribute services and assess service quality appropriately. Aside from these issues, the quality enterprise itself should be able to see the list of the items supplied by the distributor and, as necessary, approve or comment on incoming requests before sending a confirmation to the NGO and the distributor.

About our project:
Using software engineering techniques, we want to build a food management solution system that will improve the proper usage of the food distribution services offered by various food organizations and, in turn, design a system to address the primary food crisis issues that shelter enterprises confront.
The Food Management solution will allow the shelter to send multiple requests to the NGO, who will only approve them before sending them to another enterprise, such as the distributor, who will then send them to Quality for the provided stock of items. In this way, the quality of the food will not be compromised as it is delivered to the shelter enterprise, and human loss due to a lack of food services will also be avoided.
The system under consideration is based on factors including request generation, request approval from various enterprises, and request forwarding to more enterprises.
Our ultimate goal is to create a system for managing food that will produce requests for food from various shelters in various cities, accept the main request, and then transport the quality-checked food to various shelters in accordance with the authorized levels and services.
